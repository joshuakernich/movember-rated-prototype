Do they seem open? Anxious? Both? Are they raising their voice and appearing agitated/irritable? Listen to what they’re saying beyond their words. It’ll guide you on how to move forward and could provide some vital clues.</li><li><strong>Give your full attention.</strong> Put down your phone, turn off the TV and choose a place with no distractions or as few as possible. It shows respect and that you’ve made this a priority.</li><li><strong>Take what’s being said seriously.</strong> If a man says he’s ‘stressed’ or ‘feeling low’, accept it.</li><li>Don’t attempt to provide reasons why he shouldn’t feel exactly how he feels. This is not helpful.</li><li>Listen and offer support. Let them know they don’t have to go through this alone and that you’re there for them.</li><li>Reflect back what the man has said -‘it seems that/it sounds like/I get the impression that…’‘It sounds like he really upset you’.</li><li>Summarise the situation ‘it seems as though you felt that decision was unfair...I get the sense that you’re pretty frustrated and would have liked to have kept your job’.
